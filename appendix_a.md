# Appendix A: Ethical Hacking Essential Concepts - I

## Operating System Concepts

### Windows OS

#### MS-Dos-based and 9x Windows OS Versions

- MS-DOS 1.0 - 2.0 - 2.1X - 3.0 - 3.1X
- Windows 95 - 98 - 98 SE - ME

#### NT Kernel-Based Windows OS Version

For PC:

- Windows NT 3.1 - 3.51 - 3.5 - 4.0
- Windows 2000 - XP - Vista - 7 - 8 - 8.1 - 10

For Server:

- Windows server 2003 - 2003 R2
- Windows Server 2008 - Windows Home Server - 2008 R2
- Windows Server 2012 - 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2019

### Windows Architecture

The processors of the Windows system work in two different modes for operation:

- User Mode
A collection of Sub-Systems.
Has limited access to resources.
- Kernel Mode
HAL, Kernel, executive.
Unrestricted access to system memory and external devices.

### Windows Commands

### UNIX OS

Three main components:

- kernel
- shell
- programs

All files are grouped together in the directory structure.

The file system is arranged in a hierarchical structure.

The top of the hierarchy is traditionally called **root** ("/")

### Linux OS

Components:

- hardware
- kernel
- shell
- applications or Utilities
- system libraries
- daemons
- graphical server

![Linux Architecture](img/linux_architecture.png "Linux Architecture")

Features:

- portability
- open source
- multi-user
- multi-programming
- hierarchical file system
- shell
- security

### MAC OS X

... is a series of closed-source graphical os developed by Apple Inc.

... is the primary operating system for Apple's Mac computers.

Layers:

- cocoa application layer
- media layer
- core services layer
- core OS layer
- Kernel and Device Drivers layer

## File Systems

The ... is a set of data types that is employed for storage, hierarchical categorization, management, navigation, access, and recovering data.

... provide a mechanism for users to store data in a hierarchy of files and directories.

... includes a format for specifying the path to a file.

... is organized in the form of tree-structured directories.

Major ... include:

- FAT
- NTFS
- HFS+
- APFS
- Ext2
- Ext3
- Ext4
- others

Types of File Systems:

- shared disk
- disk
- network
- database
- flash
- tape
- special purpose

### File Allocation Table (FAT)

... is used with DOS

... was the first FS used with Windows OS

... is placed at the beginning of the volume.

... contains three different versions:

|System|Bytes per cluster|Cluster limit|
|---|---|---|
|FAT12|1,5|Fewer than 4.087|
|FAT16|2|4.087 - 65.526|
|FAT32|4|65.526 - 268.435.456|

FAT32 is derived from a FAT file system and supports drives up to 2 terabytes in size.
It uses drive space efficiently and uses small clusters.
It crete backups of the FAT instead of using the default copy.

### New TEchnology File System (NTFS)

... is the standard FS of windows >= NT

... includes several improvements.
